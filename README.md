# Daily Fantasy Prediction

The purpose of this repository is to house all the code used to make daily MLB fantasy predictions on Fanduel, DraftKings & Yahoo. In addition, this houses code for evaluation that produces Plotly charts as well as two-sample T tests for evaluation of statistical significance. 

MLB_Pull contains the bulk of the code (all of the manipulation, scraping & modeling), and score_eval contains the evaluation.
